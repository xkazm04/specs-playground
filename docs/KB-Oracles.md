## What is
Oracles are bridges between traditional web world and decentralized Web 3.0 ecosystem. Basically network of computers gathers various data sources as a replacement of traditional API and provides data into marketplace where dozens of blockchain network could consume it trustless without fear data could be tamper.

Mechanisms TBD rozv√©st
- Reputation system
- Motivation system
- Tamper proof

Bridge between traditional and web3 world 
- Decentralized API

## Why might want
Use cases
- Price feed
- Sports betting
- Randomness generator

## Problems solved
- Trust
- Double-spending attacks
- Blockchain oracle problem

## How to implement
Choose oracle provider based blockchain network - most chains covered by Chainlink
Install dependencies
Use prepared Chainlink interfaces into your smart contract


Solidity example

```Solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.7;

import "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol";

contract PriceConsumerV3 {
    AggregatorV3Interface internal priceFeed;

    /**
     * Network: Kovan
     * Aggregator: ETH/USD
     * Address: 0x9326BFA02ADD2366b30bacB125260Af641031331
     */
    constructor() {
        priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(0x9326BFA02ADD2366b30bacB125260Af641031331);
    }

    /**
     * Returns the latest price
     */
    function getLatestPrice() public view returns (int) {
        (
            /*uint80 roundID*/,
            int price,
            /*uint startedAt*/,
            /*uint timeStamp*/,
            /*uint80 answeredInRound*/
        ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
        return price;
    }
}
```


## Common pitfalls
- Cost
- Market monopolly
